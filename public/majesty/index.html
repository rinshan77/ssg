Its legacy is evident in:</text></p><ul><li><text>The archetypal "hero's journey" that has become a staple of fantasy narratives</text></li><li><text>The trope of the "fellowship," a diverse group banding together to face a common foe</text></li><li><text>The concept of a richly detailed fantasy world, which has become a benchmark for the genre</text></li></ul><h2><text>Conclusion</text></h2><p><text>As we stand at the threshold of this mystical realm, it is clear that </text><em>The Lord of the Rings</em><text> is not merely a series but a gateway to a world that continues to enchant and inspire.
