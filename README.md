This was the second guided project from boot.dev.

I initially made this same guided project as "gensite" under this github account.

Admittedly, for that project I was rushing and kinda cheating, asking bots to help me finish functions.

On a second or third look, I noticed that "gensite" was outright cheating, importing the markdown library and using its methods for an easy way out.


So I decided to do the project from scratch. 75% of the project is enjoyable and clear. But somehow at the end of the project, when you are supposed to 
bring all of your code together, it seems the most complicated.

I was getting a barely functional static site from the code I wrote from scratch, unable to see why only SOME parts of the html code weren't rendered properly.

That's where I learned about proper debugging. Introducing "print(whatever)" into your code is actually not the best way to truly debug your code, and I wish
that boot.dev was teaching real, proper debugging before this project.

I cannot write a "print(vars of this function)" at the end of every function when this project in particular has around 30 different functions working and breathing together, entangled in every possible way.

The biggest lesson I have taken from this project isn't string, list, dictionary, class manipulations to transform one format into another format... The most valuable thing I have learned from this project is UNIT TESTS and how to read the error or failure messages properly and how to not try to make the errors or failures just disappear, but genuinely understand the faults in my code.

That said, I won't be touching this project for a long time :).

See you in the next guided project!
